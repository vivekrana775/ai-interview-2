# AI Integration Documentation

This document describes how the Dynamic Interview Assistant uses AI to power its features.

## Prompt Design Strategy

### 1. Interview Question Generation

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt to generate personalized interview questions based on the job description and candidate CV. The prompt instructs the AI to:

- Focus on the specific requirements in the job description
- Consider the candidate's background and experience from their CV
- Generate questions that assess both technical skills and soft skills
- Create questions that are specific to the candidate and role

Example prompt structure:
\`\`\`
You are an AI interviewer. Based on the following job description and candidate CV,
generate 5 personalized interview questions that will help assess the candidate's fit for the role.

Job Description:
[job description text]

Candidate CV:
[CV text]

Generate 5 interview questions that are specific to this candidate and role.
Format the output as a JSON array of strings.
\`\`\`

### 2. Dynamic Interview Conversation

For the interview itself, we use a system message that provides context about the job and candidate, along with guidelines for conducting the interview. The AI is instructed to:

- Ask one question at a time
- Focus on relevant skills for the position
- Adapt questions based on previous answers
- Ask follow-up questions when appropriate
- Be professional and respectful
- Conclude after 5-7 questions

### 3. Resume Analysis

For resume analysis, the prompt instructs the AI to:

- Compare the resume against the job description
- Identify matching and missing skills
- Assess experience and education relevance
- Identify strengths and weaknesses
- Provide recommendations for improvement
- Format the output as a structured JSON object

### 4. Interview Scoring

The interview scoring prompt combines:

- The job description
- The candidate's CV
- The full conversation history
- Response timing data

The AI evaluates the candidate on:

1. Technical Acumen
2. Communication Skills
3. Problem-Solving & Adaptability
4. Cultural Fit & Soft Skills
5. Response Time

## Scoring Criteria

The scoring algorithm evaluates candidates on five key dimensions:

1. **Technical Acumen (0-100)**

   - Knowledge and skills relevant to the position
   - Understanding of industry-specific concepts
   - Depth and accuracy of technical responses

2. **Communication Skills (0-100)**

   - Clarity and conciseness of responses
   - Ability to explain complex concepts
   - Professional communication style

3. **Problem-Solving & Adaptability (0-100)**

   - Approach to solving problems presented in questions
   - Creativity and critical thinking
   - Ability to adapt to hypothetical scenarios

4. **Cultural Fit & Soft Skills (0-100)**

   - Alignment with company values
   - Teamwork and collaboration indicators
   - Leadership and interpersonal skills

5. **Response Time (0-100)**
   - Speed of responses relative to question complexity
   - Balance between thoughtfulness and efficiency
   - Consistency of response times throughout the interview

### Timing Metrics Influence

Response times are analyzed in the context of question complexity:

- Very fast responses to complex questions may indicate pre-prepared answers or lack of depth
- Very slow responses might indicate uncertainty or difficulty with the topic
- Consistent response times show preparation and confidence
- Appropriate response times (faster for simple questions, more thoughtful for complex ones) are rated highest

The overall score is calculated as a weighted average of these five dimensions, with the weights determined by the AI based on the specific job requirements.

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:

1. If AI response parsing fails, fallback responses are provided
2. If the AI service is unavailable, the user is notified
3. Default scoring is available if the scoring API fails

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to the AI integration:

1. Fine-tuning models on interview data
2. Adding video analysis for non-verbal cues
3. Implementing multi-language support
4. Adding personality assessment
5. Incorporating industry-specific evaluation criteria
